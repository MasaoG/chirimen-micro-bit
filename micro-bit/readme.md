# About

You can build a CHIRIMEN environment by programming the code in this into micro: bit through makecode. Basically, there is no need to change the micro: bit code in WebApps in the CHIRIMEN environment. It behaves like firmware.

The public URL of this code itself in makecode is this: https://makecode.microbit.org/_d4hA9cWMz5rC
