# CHIRIMEN with micro:bit

## About
This repository contains an implementation of the CHIRIMEN environment, which combines a micro:bit and a computer with a web browser over Bluetooth. You can use micro:bit's I2C, GPIO pins, and even built-in sensors and displays from WebApps through WebGPIO, WebI2C, etc.

### Note
The predecessor of this is https://github.com/chirimen-oh/webGPIO-etc-on-microbit-via-webBluetooth, but it has a completely different implementation due to the limited resources of micro:bit. So a new repository has been launched.
